    <p>Massachusetts is the national leader in so many areas, but not in fighting climate change.</p>
    <p>Scientists tell us we must take "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.  Then why don't we have a state law telling us how to get to 100% renewable energy?  Help our state's elected leaders get the message: you care about the future of our home, and you want bold action taken to fight climate change, starting NOW.</p>
    <p>Sign here.</p>

    <p>Massachusetts is in the minority of states that doesn't require representatives' votes taken in committee to be made public.  Bold action and forceful law-making requires robust transparency, which we don't have.  We need rules that allow us to hold our representatives accountable.</p>
    <p>Tell them that these house rules need to change, starting NOW.</p>
    <p>Sign here.</p>
